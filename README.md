# first-portfolio

## Description
The purpose of this first portfolio was to begin to develop a webpage that can eventually be shown to future potential employers to give them a bit about me, projects I have worked on, and how to contact me. It also serves a as a platform to demonstrate my current web development capabilities by showcasing various HTML and CSS skills such as the use of flex-boxes, positioning elements, and responsive design.
